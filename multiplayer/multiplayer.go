/*
Creates a Local Area Network (LAN) server and connects clients to it, providing a way for multiple computers
to communicate over the internet.

The easiest and most secure way to establish a connection between computers is by creating a
Virtual Private Network (VPN). There are many applications online that create such networks and provide an
IP that can be used by the connecting clients, alongside the server's port. This way, players decide who
gets to join their network, somewhat preventing in-game hacking and unfair play.
