// TODO:
inputfield cycle selection with double click
inputfield bug, set cursor & select indices to 0 if not typing fixes it but causes another bug
graphics node parent rework for simpler API
single tilemap object & render through shader, multiple textures as uniforms

test scale texture repeat sprite
gui button would be nice to be able to press multiple hotkeys at once
gui xml doesn't allow some symbols such as '>' and '&', the strings can be swapped with placeholders, see internal.go
